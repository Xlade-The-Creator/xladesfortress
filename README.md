Xlade's Fortress

A W.I.P. Website, of which the contents of are not completely figured out, just yet 

This is a project that Xlade is not going to dedicate all of his time to, since there are other 
priorities—such as a job, food, family, a home, and other things in life—which he is putting above some words and pictures on the internet.

This is also going to be a learning experience, along with an interesting challenge, which will most likely further Xlade's knowledge regarding Web Development, and related coding skills.

Do not attempt to reach out to Xlade, unless he's previously contacted you, if he knows you in real life, or if you and Xlade know of each other on Discord.

This specific Project has been officially started, on March 8th, 2025.
