# Xlade's Fortress   

* A W.I.P. website, of which the contents of are not completely figured out, just yet.  
* This is a project that Xlade is *not* going to dedicate **all of his time** to, since there are *other priorities*—such as a **job**, **food**, **family**, a **home**, and other things in life—which he is putting above *some words and pictures on the internet*.   
* This is also going to be a *learning experience*, along with an interesting challenge, which will most likely further Xlade's knowledge regarding **web development**, and related coding skills.   
* **Do not attempt to reach out to Xlade, unless he's previously contacted you, if he knows you in real life, or if you and Xlade know of each other on Discord**.   
***This specific project has been officially started, on March 8th, 2025***.
